# Iot_Tracking_Device
This project is a simple and effective IoT tracking device using Arduino Nano. It sends the real-time GPS location via SMS or phone call using a SIM900A GSM module.
Components Used
 Arduino Nano
 SIM900A GSM Module
 NEO-6M GPS Module
 HC-05 Bluetooth Module (optional)
 LEDs and Buzzer for indicators
How It Works
 When the device receives an SMS or call, it fetches the GPS coordinates and sends them back via SMS. Buzzers and LEDs indicate status. It requires a proper hardware connection of all components to function.
